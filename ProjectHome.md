This is a back port of the multiprocessing package introduced via PEP-371 and Python 2.6. This is essentially for meta-fork of the original pyprocessing project found at: http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/

Source bundles as well as Windows binaries are available on the Python Package Index http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocessing/
